It was cold and damp,\
It had been dark for a while\
I should have seen about that lamp\
But I’d been running in circles\
Mile after mile\
Where’d you go?

One day you knocked at my door\
I wasn’t ready to open\
“Go away!” I screamed, and more\
But you stood there\
Smiling your bright sun-kissed smile\
A hammer in your sweaty palms\
My crumbling walls,\
You had powered through\
Where’d you go?

You unlocked my windows\
And threw away the key\
Said in your nectar like voice\
“Don’t need that, now you have me”\
You made me cry, You made me bleed\
Filled me with more happiness\
Than I’d ever need\
I melted into your skin\
Your fingers lost in my hair,\
Where’d you go?

I sink each moment, I gasp for air\
Fingers trembling with every letter you sent\
Broken, in despair\
I know you have places to be\
And Demons, you need to tame\
I know you want to be free\
And I know there’s no one to blame

But I guess my question is,\
Why didn’t you also take me?

It is cold and damp,\
It has been dark for a while\
I should see about that lamp\
But I’ve been running in circles,\
Mile after mile\
Where’d you go?
