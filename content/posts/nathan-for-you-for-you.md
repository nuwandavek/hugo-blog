Since [Nathan For You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_for_You) ended, there has been a deep void left in the world. Despite what the System has been trying to tell you, crypto cannot <i>actually</i> solve all problems (I verified üò¢). So, a bunch of nerds got together to create God, obviously. Once we have God, we can make a perfect replica of Nathan. We can then make that Nathan have a hundred babies and send them out to struggling businesses worldwide. But since they only made a stupid baby God, beware that the <b>Nathan For You For You</b> plans may at times be impractical or dumb, unlike the air-tight solutions on the show.
